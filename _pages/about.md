Hello! 

My name is Sakshi Arya. I am an Assistant Professor of Statistics in the Department of Mathematics, Applied Mathematics and Statistics at Case Western Reserve University.  
I received my PhD in Statistics at University of Minnesota in May 2020 advised by [Prof. Yuhong Yang]{http://users.stat.umn.edu/~yangx374/}. Before joining Case, I spent two years as a postdoctoral fellow at Penn State working at the intersection of sequential decision making and kernel methods with [Prof. Bharath Sriperumbudur]{https://bharathsv.github.io/index.html}. Before that, I spent some time as a postdoctoral scholar in 2021 working on climate modeling for hurricanes with [Prof. Snigdhansu Chatterjee]{http://ansuchatterjee.com/} <br>

My main research interests are nonparametric estimation, sequential decision making problems in particular contextual bandit problems, statistical learning theory and machine learning. My CV can be found here <a href="/assets/pdf/SakshiCV.pdf" target="_blank">CV</a>.<br> --> 
<!-- and papers my [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=A-sLpqsAAAAJ&hl=en&authuser=1) and my and <a href="/assets/pdf/Research_Statement.pdf" target="_blank">full Research Statement</a>.<br> -->


<!-- Beyond developing methodology, I like teaching and mentoring young minds to kindle and foster statistical thinking and logical reasoning skills. <br> -->

<!-- 
In my spare time, I enjoy reading, music, and watching soccer. I am a big fan of the Harry Potter books. -->
