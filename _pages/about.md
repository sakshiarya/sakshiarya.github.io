I am an Assistant Professor of Statistics in the Department of Mathematics, Applied Mathematics and Statistics at Case Western Reserve University. I received my PhD in Statistics at University of Minnesota in May 2020 advised by [Prof. Yuhong Yang](http://users.stat.umn.edu/~yangx374/). Before joining Case, I spent two years as a postdoctoral fellow at Penn State working at the intersection of sequential decision making and kernel methods with [Prof. Bharath Sriperumbudur](https://bharathsv.github.io/index.html). Before that, I spent some time as a postdoctoral scholar in 2021 working on climate modeling for hurricanes with [Prof. Snigdhansu Chatterjee](http://ansuchatterjee.com/). <br>

My main research interests are 
-  sequential decision making problems in particular contextual bandit problems,
- nonparametric statistics,
-  statistical learning theory, inverse problems and machine learning.

If you are interested in knowing more about my work, contact me by [email](mailto:sxa1351@case.edu). Students interested in doing research with me or working on the Capstone project, please make sure you reach out to me at least in the Fall semester prior to enrolling in the Capstone course. 

## News:
- I'll be attending the IISA conference [https://www.intindstat.org/conference2025/index] from June 12-15, 2025.
