Current Research Interests
---------------

+ **Statistics on non-Euclidean object-valued data**-
developing broadly applicable statistical methods and inference for analyzing non-Euclidean data residing in abstract metric spaces, with applications in brain imaging studies, mortality and life expectancy distributions, child neurological development, traffic network analysis, and genetics data.
+ **Functional and longitudinal data analysis, and its overlap with metric geometry** for studying samples of time-varying metric space-valued data, examples being dynamic networks or distribution objects
+ **Reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces**- developing abstract mathematical and computational methods for infinite dimensional data in connection with metric geometry and sufficient dimension reduction.
+ **Nonparametric statistics**, analysis of high-dimensional and geometrical data.
+ **Causal inference for distributional and object data**- developing methodological work for object data analysis with application in the fields of bio-sciences.
+ **Theoretical machine learning**- contextual bandit problems.<br>
